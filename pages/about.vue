            A frequent annoyance when talking to recruiters in tech is that you often repeat the same questions to each of them. These back and forth chats are also
            asynchronous most of the time. This causes a long turnaround for figuring out whether you are in fact interested in the job the recruiter is trying to sell you on.
            I have created Pallet with the hope that candidates in the tech space can compile their list of questions once off and share it with these would-be headhunters.
            <br /><br />
            This might also ease the lives of recruiters as they can opt to ask the candidates to share their respective Pallet forms, or even ask them to create their
            question list for the first time. I feel that this can help candidates understand what they like and dislike about an opportunity a lot quicker than a typical
            instant messaging conversation, saving candidates and recruiters a lot of time.

            Yes, this app is free. No that does not mean you or your data is the product of Pallet. If monetisation becomes feasible or neccessary, it will be in the form of
            value-added features only.
